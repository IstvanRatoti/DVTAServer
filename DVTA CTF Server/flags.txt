Cert pinning bypass:
FLAG{c3r7_p1nn1n9_15_n3v3r_7h3_4n5w3r}
Given to the user after registering successfully.

Crack sharon's hash:
FLAG{wh47_w45_my_p455w0rd_4941n?}
Found when asking for the user's email address.

Get mike's expenses:

The flag is the admin hash. Need to sniff the traffic, find the debug info and use nc to log in using the password hash.

Get the sql database creds:
FLAG{7h3y_701d_m3_1_c0u1d_83_4ny7h1n9,_50_1_83c4m3_4n_5q1_53rv3r}
Flag is in the ftpcreds table. Inject the server IP into the xml, then capture the authentication request.

Get the ftp creds:
FLAG{5h0u1d_h4v3_u53d_435}
Flag is copied onto the ftp server. The ftp pass can be recovered by cracking the repeating key xor. The server executable should be on the ftp server too.

Get shell or command execution on the machine:
FLAG{y_50_53ri41}
Flag is in the executable's directory. Find the serialization vulnerability and exploit it.
